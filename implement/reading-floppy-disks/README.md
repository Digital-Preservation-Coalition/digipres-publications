README
======

Started with:

```
pandoc Guide\ -\ Reading\ obscure\ floppy\ disk\ formats.docx -o index.md --wrap=none -t commonmark --extract-media=.
```

Then had to tweak:

- Move some information like title and authors into structured frontmatter.
- Remove styling inside hyperlinks (underlines) as this confuses Typst.
